I noticed that I always loved bringing technology into the classroom and that my favorite days were the ones that I could play around with the latest educational technology tools. So in June of 2017 I decided I wanted to do a coding bootcamp after talking with a couple friends who went through similar programs. In my research, I came across DevBootcamp and instantly knew that was where I wanted to go. I applied, got in, and traveled to San Francisco in order to complete the program in November of 2017. As the last cohort of DevBootcamp, I had the unique opportunity to stay for a couple extra weeks and complete two final projects. It has been a whirlwind experience but definitely the best decision of my life.</p>
